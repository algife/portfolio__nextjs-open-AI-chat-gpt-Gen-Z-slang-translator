# ZLinguist: Gen-Z Slang Translator

Available publicly at [ZLinguist site](https://zlinguist.vercel.app)

> Transform your speech into Gen-z slang and viceversa and optimize your marketing efforts for this target audience.

- If you don't <b>understand Gen-Zers</b> when they speak between them. We get you covered.
- If you want to <b>sound like an authentic Gen-Zer</b>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## To-do

- [x] Create the repository using git-flow and initialize the Next.js 14 project.
- [x] Make a "Translator" UI with Tailwind.
- [ ] Integrate the logic with OpenAI with an injected prompt to generate an equivalent Gen-Z speech.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
